<!-- 
    Inline styles in Angular  are declared as 
    [ngStyle] and declare a css style as string

    For the click event Angular declares it as (click) 
    event and it must be linked to a method (in this
    case we'll name it 'onClick()')
-->
<button 
[ngStyle]="{'background-color': color}" 
(click)="onClick()"
class="btn">
    {{text}}
</button>
